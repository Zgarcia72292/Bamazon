# Bamazon

Bamazon is an app that creates a simple virtual shopping experience.

<br/>

Upon running the app, the user will be prompted to select an shopping item from a table that is linked to a mysql database.

<br/>

The user may select an item by inputting the id number of the product. 

<br/>

After selecting an item, the user will have to choose the quantity of the item they wish to purchase.

<br/>

The app will then provide the user with the total cost of their purchase, update the table accordingly, and ask them if they would like to continue shopping.
